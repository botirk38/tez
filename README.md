## 🔥 Overview

The Tez Database Management System is a C++-based project that provides a basic database management system with SQL parsing capabilities. It includes features such as a B-tree index, SQL parser, and database management.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **B-tree Indexing**: Efficient indexing for fast data retrieval
- ✅ **SQL Parsing**: Parse SQL queries for execution
- ✅ **Database Management**: Manage database operations such as create, read, update, and delete

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
- CMake for building
- VCPKG for dependency management

### 🛠 Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/botirk38/tez.git`
2. Build the project using CMake: `cmake .` and `make`
3. Install dependencies using VCPKG: `vcpkg install`

## ▶️ Usage

1. Run the database management system: `./tez`
2. Execute SQL queries: `SELECT * FROM table_name`

### 📚 Architecture Overview

The Tez Database Management System consists of several key components:

* **B-tree Indexing**: Provides efficient indexing for fast data retrieval
* **SQL Parser**: Parses SQL queries for execution
* **Database Management**: Manages database operations such as create, read, update, and delete
* **Thread Pool**: Handles concurrent database operations

### 📝 Error Handling

The Tez Database Management System uses a combination of error codes and exception handling to manage errors and exceptions. Error codes are used to indicate specific error conditions, while exceptions are used to handle unexpected errors.

### 📊 Future Development

The Tez Database Management System is actively being developed and expanded. Future plans include:

* Implementing additional SQL features
* Improving performance and scalability
* Adding support for multiple database formats

Contributors are welcome to participate in the development process and help shape the future of the Tez Database Management System.
